# Clan Info

- **Clan Name:** _Ermahgerd Flermerngers_
- **System:** ***All platforms*** -- Xbox, PC, and PS4, all one big happy family in our Discord server (PC clan is currently at capacity; if you join now, you could be waitlisted)
- **Location:** ***Every US timezone*** -- plus several outside North America
- **Play Times:** ***Daily, usually 4pm-9pm Pacific (7pm-12am Eastern)*** -- but we've been known to get groups together at other random times.

# What We're About!

Online gaming can be pretty toxic -- the anonymity, competition, stress, and lack of face-to-face connection / empathy seem to bring out the worst in some people. To maximize fun for everyone, **The Flermerngers stand in _complete opposition_ to gaming toxicity.** We are an 18+ clan.

**We are:**

- 🤪 here to have silly fun
- 👥 a team-based group and actively seek out clanmates when we play
- 🤝 respectful to our teammates _and_ opponents
- 🌈 proud to be part of a community that supports diversity in gaming, and we stand together against harassment, intolerance, and hate
- 👋 welcoming and inclusive of all friendly folks who join our community
- ❤️ happy to lend fellow Flerms our help and support when we can

# Clan Rules

1. 💖 **Wear Pink in Game** -- We love the image of us rolling into an Iron Banner match as a six-stack, united in a goofy love of the game and our community.
2. 🙊 **Don't Be a Dick** -- We take this seriously and have a thoughtful [conduct policy](http://link.flerm.me/conduct) outlining what we consider problematic.
3. 💬 **Participate Frequently** -- We’re an all welcoming and inclusive group and the best way to foster that is an active, respectful community. Even if you can’t participate in-game, chat with us in our Discord!

If you would have difficulty meeting our standards, please look elsewhere!  There are lots of clans out there that set a _much_ lower bar.  But if you think this sounds awesome, and that it would be super easy because you already live this daily without even trying -- then **come on in!**

# How Do I Join?

If we seem like a good fit for you, check out our website [flerm.me](http://flerm.me/) for more details -- you can fill out a brief form there to join our Discord server. An official clan invite can be requested once your participation in the clan reaches a certain level (which is tracked by a bot, and you can check).

Once you’ve joined the Discord, you’ll need to take two more steps:

Step 1. Send the command **%register** in the register-here channel to start the registration process with our bot Charlemagne.

Step 2. Send the command **!join-platform** and replace platform with **PC, Xbox, or PS4.**
